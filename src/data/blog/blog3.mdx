I have rewritten my blog with Next.JS and have it running on Vercel. I have nothing to report about what I learned doing it because it was pretty straightforward. Most of it involved translating between different syntaxes (Preact => React, Fresh => Next.JS, etc).

The other big thing I got in this remake is using [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) for posts instead of Markdown. This means I can do really fun inline React things should I get the inspiration.

I ended up breaking the comments system in the move. I don't have any plans to bring it back as it was largely unused.
